# Instructions

The `Makefile` contains the following targets.

> make coverage

generates a code coverage report (`lcov` needs to be installed first).

> make memcheck

runs the memory check tool of `valgrind`.

> make profile

runs the `callgrind` tool of `valgrind` (profiler).
Results generated by `callgrind` can be inspected, *e.g.* with `KCacheGrind`.
