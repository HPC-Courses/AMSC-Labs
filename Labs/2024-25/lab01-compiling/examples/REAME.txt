in the src folder, if you already have Eigen in the compiler path, simply type
```bash
make
```
if you want a faster building, type
```bash
make -j
```
To see if Eigen is in the -I path, check the env variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH,
if it is not in the path, add it by typing
```bash
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/u/sw/toolchains/gcc-glibc/11.2.0/pkgs/eigen/3.3.9/include/eigen3"
```

To rm the *.o files,
```bash
make clean
```
